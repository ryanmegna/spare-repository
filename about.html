                 This is where you can learn more about me, my hobbies, my background
                and my experience in computer science!
                <br>
                I am a 19 year old computer science major from Massachusetts, now attending the University of Rhode Island. When I'm not focusing on school work, you can often find me
                working on my cars, fishing, snowboarding, or hanging out with my friends. I also really enjoy photography and hope to always express my passions
                with photos! I was very shy and timid growing up, partially because I came from a small farm town in the middle of nowhere, but intend to change that in college. I have always
                had a love for computers and how they worked from a young age. The first real computer game I played was <e>Roblox</e>, which allowed users to create their own games using LuaC.
                I always wanted to learn a language like that to make my own games, so I finally started watching tutorials and reading forums online and that is when I discovered my love for
                programming. I inted on trying further my career after college in either game development or cybersecurity.
